    "In this notebook, you may choose your own antibody framework and target protein structure, and design novel antibody binders. This workflow has been shown to generate weak antibody binders in the μM to nM range, with up to ~5-10% experimental success rates for some degree of binding.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Antibody therapeutics represent a substantial market (approximately $550M USD) with tremendous potential for treating various diseases. Traditional approaches to antibody discovery are slow and laborious, typically involving immunizing mice or screening random libraries. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements the RFantibody pipeline for structure-based design of de novo antibodies against a chosen target.\n",
    "\n",
    "It takes two inputs:\n",
    "- i) An input antibody framework (e.g. hu-4D5-8_Fv.pdb - a humanized single-domain antibody already approved in two FDA therapies)\n",
    "- ii) A target protein of interest (e.g. respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) protein) with binding site (epitope residues)\n",
    "\n",
    "And runs the following three methods:\n",
    "1. **De novo design of an antibody backbone targeting a protein of interest** - using an antibody-finetuned version of RFdiffusion ([Nature paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06415-8))\n",
    "2. **Design of the CDR loop residues** - using ProteinMPNN ([Science paper](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.add2187))\n",
    "3. **Filtering designs on predicted structure 'self-consistency'** - using an antibody-finetuned version of RoseTTAFold2 ([Preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.24.542179v1)), shown to correlate with significantly improved experimental success rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The RFantibody pipeline itself is described in detail in [this preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.03.14.585103v2).\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "- Designs novel antibodies binding a target protein\n",
    "- Can target most epitope binding region of interest (preferring structured regions)\n",
    "- Focuses on designing antibody CDR loops (main residues determining binding)\n",
    "- Designs may be filtered by \"self-cosistency\" of predicted structures, correlating with experimental success rates\n",
    "\n",
    "Current limitations:\n",
    "- Generated antibodies at best tend to be weak binders (low binding affinities in μM to nM range)\n",
    "- Often low experimental success rates (~5-10% for some degree of binding) - heavily dependent on filtering\n",
    "- No screening for e.g. human immunogenicity"

    "This notebook has demonstrated the complete RFantibody pipeline for structure-based design of de novo antibodies. The workflow consists of three main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **RFdiffusion (antibody fine-tuned)**: Generating antibody-target docking poses with designed CDR loop structures\n",
    "2. **ProteinMPNN (antibody fine-tuned)**: Designing amino acid sequences for the CDR loops\n",
    "3. **RosettaFold2 (antibody fine-tuned)**: Filtering designs based on predicted structure quality\n",
    "4. **AntibodyProfiler**: Further selection of designs based on similarity to therapeutically approved antibodies\n",
    "\n",
    "This computational pipeline can generate designs with a success rate of approximately 5-10% for some degree of binding to the target. Further experimental validation and optimization is likely to be required to improve binding affinity and other pharmaceutical properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "For larger scale antibody design campaigns, we recommended to generating thousands of designs to increase the chances of finding high-quality binders, as the current filtering metrics are still highly limited."
